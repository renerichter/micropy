# The MicroPy Toolbox
This is my image-processing-toolbox built upon custom-toolboxes like NanoImagingPack (Bioimaging Group Jena) and more general toolboxes like Numpy, Scipy or sci-kit.


# Getting started
*	Install what needs to be installed.


# Notes
*	The toolbox does (for now) not install or force any dependencies. Hence, it is required that you have at least NanoImagingPack installed and running.
